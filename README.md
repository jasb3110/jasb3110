👋 Hi, I’m @jasb3110.
👀 I’m interested in studying fish population fluctuations off the central coast of Peru during Termination 1 (from the Last Glacial Maximum to the Holocene). My research explores how deoxygenation and low productivity affect fish distribution, based on estimates from preserved fish remains, such as scales and vertebrae. Currently, I am also working to support artisanal fisheries for invertebrates and environmental management.
🌱 I’m currently learning Python to apply it to paleo-ecology models.
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on recreating past fish populations in ancient marine environments.
